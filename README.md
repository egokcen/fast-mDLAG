Fast mDLAG contains methods for dramatically accelerating the fitting of
Delayed Latents Across (multiple) Groups (mDLAG) models. mDLAG is a dimensionality
reduction framework for characterizing the multi-dimensional, concurrent flow of signals
across multiple groups of time series (for example, the recorded activity of multiple
neuronal populations). As preliminaries to this work, see 
[this paper](https://nips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/70171) and its
accompanying [repository](https://github.com/egokcen/mDLAG).

## Overview

This codepack includes implementations of the primary contributions of the paper: a
method to fit mDLAG via inducing variables (mDLAG-inducing), and a method to fit mDLAG
via the frequency domain (mDLAG-frequency). To keep the codepack self-contained, the
baseline approach to fitting mDLAG (mDLAG-time) is also included (original repository
[here](https://github.com/egokcen/mDLAG)). See also 
[this repository](https://github.com/egokcen/DLAG) for a frequency
domain approach to fitting [DLAG](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00282-5.epdf?sharing_token=hyFsoNFZfDyh-EVI76hoddRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Nm1Wps5WZ1Nog-dORHPLUG97YnGS0JZBkvhpO7c5pblBICIHRXMKZ04hmmro2Tn12HIbx2e2LrperSJc6bwzqptnPIaVOrqvl8DcloXzDaOBhLlAqzUvwM4uMyl96KvTE%3D).

The codepack directory structure is as follows:
- `mDLAG`

  Self-contained implementations of mDLAG-time and mDLAG-frequency.
  `mDLAG/demo/demo_mdlag.m` is a script that provides a generic demonstration of
  mDLAG-time. `mDLAG/demo/demo_mdlag_freq.m` provides a generic demonstration of
  mDLAG-frequency and comparison to mDLAG-time.

- `smDLAG`

  A self-contained implementation of mDLAG-inducing. `smDLAG/demo/demo_smdlag.m` is a
  script that provides a generic demonstration of mDLAG-inducing.
  
  There will be some conflicting function definitions across `mDLAG` and `smDLAG`. We 
  take care of these namespace issues throughout the codepack. Just beware of these
  potential conflicts if you plan to use both `mDLAG` and `smDLAG` in your own project.
  
  Note that mDLAG-inducing is referred to as smDLAG throughout the codepack, for
  "sparse mDLAG". In the Gaussian process (GP) literature, inducing variables fall under
  the umbrella of sparse GP methods. In the paper, we chose to avoid "sparse mDLAG" in
  favor of mDLAG-inducing to distinguish between different flavors of sparsity, for
  example the sparsity imposed on the loading matrices by automatic relevance
  determination.

- `simulation`

  The code and results to reproduce analyses and figures related to simulated
  experiments. The original datasets are themselves too large to store in this
  repository. However, the scripts and random seeds needed to reproduce those datasets
  locally on your own machine are included. The relevant subdirectories and the figures
  to which they relate are as follows:
    - `basic_demo`: Figs. 1 and 2
    - `scaling_seqlength`: Figs. 3 and 7, Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, and 8
    - `scaling_numgroups`: Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 7
    - `circulant_demo`: Figs. 1 and 6, Supplementary Fig. 9
    - `bias_modelselection`: Fig. 8
    - `scaling_samplingrate`: Supplementary Fig. 7
    - `scaling_neurons`: Supplementary Fig. 7

- `npx`

  Part of the data, code, and results to reproduce analyses and figures related to the
  Neuropixels recordings. The related
  figures are as follows:
    - Fig. 5, Supplementary Figs. 3â€“6 and 10

## System requirements

This codepack was written in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc.), and must be run in 
Matlab.

It has been tested on Matlab 2023b and 2024a, on Linux 
(Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 7.9) operating systems.

Note that all runtimes provided below are estimates based on these tests. Your
runtimes may vary.

Some functions rely on the C/MEX Matlab interface for speedup, whereby C code 
can be compiled and used from within Matlab. A native C compiler is necessary
to take advantage of this functionality. Windows users may require extra 
installation of, for example, Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW. The code is written
to default to a native Matlab code implementation if mex files cannot be 
properly executed, and will still work correctly.

## Installation guide

Simply download and extract the
[latest release](https://github.com/egokcen/fast-mdlag/releases) of this codepack to
your desired local directory.

Install [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

For C/MEX Compilation:
1. Enter `mDLAG` directory. Run `startup.m`.
2. Enter `smDLAG` directory. Run `startup.m`.

Assuming Matlab is already installed on your machine, setup should not take 
more than a few minutes.
